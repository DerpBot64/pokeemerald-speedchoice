# Pokémon Emerald Speedchoice Edition

UPDATE: I created a google sheet to generate the config file for the UPR randomizer based on the map file generated by the compile. Some of the values are based on differences from known values in the map file, so they may become inaccurate if code changes are made near where the offsets are located
